# NanovnaCmd: a collection of useful .cmd files for NanoVNA

These files configure some useful display setups oriented towards specific tasks.

The instructions here were tested on Nanovna-D v1.2.40.

You can use these cmd files in two ways:

1. send them to the serial port using appropriate software; and
2. copy them to the device SD card and load them from there.

## Send them to the serial port using appropriate software

I recommend Teraterm, set 10ms/char and 500ms/line delays.

## Copy them to the device SD card and load them from there

Copy them using the existing filenames and when using the Nanovna, load them from the menu: config / expert settings / more / load command script .

The choice of .cmd suffix is poor as most email virus scanners are likely to block them. But, at this time, .cmd is the only suffix that works.
